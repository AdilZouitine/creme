    """A variant of online scoring where the targets are revealed with a delay.

    ``X_y`` is converted into a question and answer where the model is asked to predict an
    observation. The target is only revealed to the model after a certain amount given by
    ``delay``.

    Parameters:
        X_y (generator): A stream of (features, target) tuples.
        model (base.Estimator)
        metric (metrics.Metric)
        moment (callable or str): The attribute used for measuring time. If a callable
            is passed, then it is expected to take as input a `dict` of features. If ``None``, then
            the observations are implicitely timestamped in the order in which they arrive.
        delay (callable or str or datetime.timedelta or int): The amount to wait before revealing
            the target associated with each observation to the model. This value is expected to be
            able to sum with the ``moment`` value. For instance, if ``moment`` is a
            `datetime.date`, then ``delay`` is expected to be a `datetime.timedelta`. If a callable
            is passed, then it is expected to take as input a `dict` of features and the target. If
            a `str` is passed, then it will be used to access the relevant field from the features.
            If ``None`` is passed, then no delay will be used, which leads to doing standard online
            validation.
        print_every (int): Iteration number at which to print the current metric. This only takes
            into account the predictions, and not the training steps.
        show_time (bool): Whether or not to display the elapsed time.
        show_memory (bool): Whether or not to display the memory usage of the model.

    Returns:
        metrics.Metric
